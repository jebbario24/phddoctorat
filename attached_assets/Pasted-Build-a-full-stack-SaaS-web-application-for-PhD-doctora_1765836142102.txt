Build a full‑stack SaaS web application for PhD/doctoral students to manage and write their thesis from start to finish.

Main goals:

Help students create a clear thesis structure (chapters, sections, milestones, deadlines).

Use AI to assist with writing (outlines, drafts, rewriting, summarizing) while respecting academic integrity and avoiding plagiarism.

Centralize everything in one dashboard: tasks, versions, supervisor feedback, references, and documents.​

Core features:

Onboarding

Sign up / login (email + password, later OAuth).

Choose study level (Master/PhD), field, and thesis language.

Simple wizard to define topic, research questions, and objectives.

Thesis Planner

Visual timeline of the thesis with milestones (proposal, literature review, methods, results, discussion, submission).

Kanban/board or checklist of tasks per chapter.

Deadline management with progress percentage.​

AI Writing Workspace

Editor like Google Docs with:

“Generate outline for this chapter”

“Rewrite this paragraph in academic tone”

“Summarize these notes into 3–4 bullet points”

“Suggest structure for literature review/methodology/results”

Highlight text → ask AI to improve clarity or coherence.

Show word count per chapter and overall.​

Reference & PDF helper (v1 simple, v2 advanced)

Let users upload PDFs of papers.

AI can: extract key points, quotes, and suggested citations for each paper; generate short summaries.

Basic reference list manager (APA/MLA/Chicago) with export.​

Supervisor collaboration

Share‑link or supervisor account with read‑only or comment permissions.

Commenting on paragraphs and chapters.

Status per chapter: “draft”, “under review”, “revised”, “final”.​

Integrity and plagiarism support

Add checks and warnings about plagiarism and over‑reliance on AI.

Integrate with or leave hooks for plagiarism APIs in the future.​

Multi‑tenant SaaS

Multi‑tenant architecture where each user (or institution) has isolated data.

Billing module: free plan with limited projects/words, paid plans with more projects, more AI tokens, and collaboration features.

Admin dashboard to see active users, usage, and subscriptions.

Tech requirements:

Modern TypeScript stack (React or Next.js frontend, Node.js/Express/Nest backend, Postgres DB).

Authentication, role‑based access (student, supervisor, admin).

Clean API layer for AI calls (can plug any LLM provider).

Responsive UI with a clean dashboard similar to modern academic/thesis tools like Paperpal/Yomu (minimal, light, focus on writing space).​

Deliver:

Database schema (tables: users, institutions, theses, chapters, tasks, documents, comments, references, plans/subscriptions, usage).

Backend endpoints and basic implementation for all features.

Frontend pages and components: landing page, signup/login, thesis dashboard, planner, editor, references, settings, billing.

Seed data for demo (1–2 example theses).

Clear README with how to run frontend, backend, and how to plug in an AI provider key.

Extra angle that differentiates you
You can also tell Antigravity that your SaaS should focus on project management + supervision workflow (deadlines, status, comments) because many existing AI tools only help with writing, not with time management and advisor communication.
